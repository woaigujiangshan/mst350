I’ve heard lots about it.”

Her smile is still kind, which confuses you.
Everything in this city confuses you.
People here are too emotional.

[[“You know about Dumor?”]]

He chuckles, and it makes you feel a little proud of yourself.
Maybe you could have a friend in this unfamiliar place.

“Alright, this is getting way too vulnerable,
I need to go before I spill all my deep secrets.
Here, I bought an //extra sandwich//, you can take it.”

Her smile is still kind, which makes you feel warm.

You still don’t understand anything about this world,
but the unconditional kindness from the woman comforts you.

“You don’t look like you’re from here, you must be from Dumor, then?”

Her smile widened as she stared off into space.

You weren’t entirely sure what she was doing,
but you didn’t spend much time thinking about it.
You were too busy wondering what she meant by ‘no Dumor and Rubellite.’

Your confusion must be clear on your face,
so when the woman turns back to you, she laughs.

“I suppose I should explain, hm? I’ll tell you a little.”

}"How is it possible for one to speak with so little feeling?
Your monotony is exhausting me.” 

Their voice stays steady, revealing little to you. 
Whatever you heard before has evaporated, 
which fills you with something you choose not to think too deeply about.

Suddenly, the stranger's warm hand wraps around your wrist, 
and they pull you forward. 

(link:"!!!")[You stumble, unable to see in front of you. 
It startles you, but you recover quickly. 

Moments later, you hear the voice comments, 

"Barely even a flinch, I’ll never get used to how robotic you people really are. 
Just come with me, we have a long way to go. 
I’m sure ''HER'' people will deal with you.”
